# Angular Gulp prototype

This is a angular prototype which I've created to display survey results as a part of some technical assesment.

I've used `gulp` as task runner to compile `SASS`. Static data files are served by `node` server.

### Installation
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:surinderpalsingh/survey.git
$ cd survey
$ bower install
$ npm install
```

### Run HTTP Server:
```bash
$ gulp
```
You can access the app on http://localhost:8000


Note: This is prototype is created a techincal test. I'll expand this prototype to embed build features and test integration. 

Thanks for reading and if you have any question/query, I'm contactable `mannecheema@gmail.com`
